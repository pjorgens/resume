\begin{flushleft}
    My name is Pierce Jorgensen. I'm a music producer and programmer. 
Electronic music has been a huge part of my life ever since I was young. 
I grew up listening to artists like Above \& Beyond, Adventure Club, Skrillex, 
DeadMau5, and Eric Prydz. Music is in my blood.
\end{flushleft}

% paragraph 2
\begin{flushleft}
    I was born in San Diego, and I've lived in many places across the U.S.
After I graduated, I moved to the East Coast to work in Aerospace. I've been very 
fortunate to be in this field. I even got to work at the Kennedy Space Center, 
which was a life-long dream of mine. Living on the Space Coast was really awesome,
and I enjoy being in Florida, but I would live anywhere for a career in music.

\begin{flushleft}
    Insomniac would be the perfect job for me. I want to give back to the community that helped 
me find myself, and show others the importance of peace, love, and unity by making
experiences that matter. I want my work to align with my values, just as much as my
personal life. To that end, below is a list of the values I hold and how I choose to live my life.
\end{flushleft}

% list
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose not to harm.
    \item Respect nature, respect others, respect yourself.
    \item Work first, play second.
    \item Never stop learning.
    \item Don't try to be better than others, be better than yourself.
    \item Don't judge by first impressions.
    \item Trust your intuition.
    \item Stand up for others and yourself.
    \item Always be willing to forgive, but know when to walk away.
\end{enumerate}
