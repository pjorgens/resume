\begin{flushleft}
    My name is Pierce Jorgensen. I'm a music producer and programmer. 
Electronic music has been a huge part of my life ever since I was young. 
I grew up listening to artists like Above \& Beyond, Adventure Club, Skrillex, 
DeadMau5, and Eric Prydz. Dance music is in my blood.

\begin{flushleft}
    I was born in San Diego, and I've lived in many places across the U.S.
After I graduated, I moved to the East Coast for work. I'm a software engineer by trade,
working in Aerospace ever since I got out of school. I've been very fortunate
to be in this field and even got to work at the Kennedy Space Center, 
which was a life-long dream of mine. Working on the Space Coast was really awesome,
and I enjoy living in Florida, but I've always had a pulse for music
and I know it's my true calling in life.

\begin{flushleft}
    Insomniac would be the perfect job for me. I can't think 
of anyone else I'd rather work for. I want to give back to the community that helped 
me find myself, and show others the importance of peace, love, and unity by making
experiences that matter. I want my work to align with my values, just as much as my
personal life. Below is a list of the values I hold and how I try to
live my life.
\end{flushleft}

% list
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose not to harm, choose love instead.
    \item Respect nature, respect others, respect yourself.
    \item Work first, play second.
    \item Never stop learning.
    \item Don't try to be better than other people, be better than yourself.
    \item Don't judge by first impressions.
    \item Trust your intuition.
    \item Stand up for others and stand up for yourself.
    \item Always be willing to forgive, but know when to walk away.
\end{enumerate}
